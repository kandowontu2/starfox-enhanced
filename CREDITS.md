# Credits

Star Fox Enhanced contains several distinct bodies of work. They are listed
separately here so the creators of the 1993 game are not conflated with the
Star Fox EX, UltraStarFox, or native-port teams. Names and roles in the first
two sections are transcribed from the credit-roll source assembled by the
corresponding game.

## Original Star Fox / Starwing (1993)

Presented by Nintendo and developed by Argonaut Software.

| Role | Credit |
|---|---|
| Executive | Hiroshi Yamauchi |
| Producer | Shigeru Miyamoto |
| Director | Katsuya Eguchi |
| Assistant director | Yoichi Yamada |
| Programming | Dylan Cuthbert; Giles Goddard; Krister Wombell |
| 3D system | Pete Warnes; Carl Graham |
| Graphic designer | Takaya Imamura |
| Shape designer | Tsuyoshi Watanabe |
| Effects | Koji Kondo |
| Composer | Hajime Hirasawa |

This is the complete staff list encoded in the original game's assembled
credit roll. Star Fox EX's abbreviated acknowledgement also names Argonaut
Software, Dylan Cuthbert, and Giles Goddard; they remain original-game credits
and are therefore not counted as members of Team SFEX below.

## Star Fox EX

Presented by Team SFEX.

| Role | Credit |
|---|---|
| Programming | KandoWontU; Sunlit |
| Additional code | Starxxon; Hayao Yokogawa; COOLK; Phonymike; Raphnet Labs; Catador |
| Super FX programming | ChuckBorisNorris; MrL314 |
| MSU-1 programming | Sunlit |
| Graphics | SegaRetro92; Hayao Yokogawa; Sunlit; Fenix; Random Stuff; Morshu; Onaji |
| Models | Euclidium; Random Stuff; COOLK; SegaRetro92; Ben Hickling; Mighty Andross 64; Sunlit and Monika |
| Music | Random Stuff; Livvy94; Phonymike; Plasmariel; EG 9371; StudsX; Shub |
| Testing | Sunlit; Chromius; Random Stuff; COOLK; Chris Highwind; Solgnar; DoctorWhosThat |
| Ideas | Sunlit; COOLK; Random Stuff; Joshua Schäferhund (Patch93); Phonymike; DoctorWhosThat |

The EX source also contains a conditional `MSU-1 SOUNDTRACK` card naming
Random Stuff, Livvy94, Plasmariel, Shub, and Church of Kondo. Its accompanying
source comment explicitly calls that list provisional, so it is preserved
here without representing it as a finalized arrangement credit.

## UltraStarFox

The native Original experience is built from
[UltraStarFox](https://github.com/Sunlitspace542/ultrastarfox). Its upstream
README credits:

- H A M G E R — wireframe shield-meter colour-changing Super FX code.
- KandoWontU — original Star Fox research, rumble sequences and effects,
  mouse support, restored debug/crash handling, limit removals, easy
  wireframes, fixes, and improvements.
- MrL314 — texture-limit-removal Super FX code.
- Phonymike — `mugconv`, `fontconv`, and the ROM header.
- Randal Linden — rumble-pad design and documentation, and rumble-pad NMI
  code.
- Repzilon — documentation.
- SegaRetro92 — texture and palette documentation, graphics tools, general
  graphics work, and German graphics/text restoration.
- Sunlit — maintenance, documentation, toolchain engineering, rumble code and
  effects, tools, German graphics/text restoration, release builds, and MSU-1
  programming.

## Star Fox Enhanced native PC port

- KandoWontU — project creator and repository author.
- agrofubris — [stereo fork](https://github.com/agrofubris/starfox-enhanced-stereo)
  reviewed for Crossview output and single-player Steam Deck controller priority;
  direct SR Platform offscreen-weave handoff at `129d917`.
- bo3b (Bo3b Johnson) — [SR-lib](https://github.com/bo3b/SR-lib) SDK packaging,
  optional-runtime and weaver lifecycle reference.
- oneup03 — [RT64 3D](https://github.com/oneup03/rt64-3D), credited by the stereo
  fork as the original SR integration approach.
- UltraStarFox and Team SFEX contributors — original and EX source mechanics,
  data, tools, research, and documentation on which the native runtime is
  based, credited individually above.

## Optional MSU-1 music companion

The optional `Starfox-MSU1.PAK` companion uses SunlitSpace542's
[Star Fox MSU-1 PCM set](https://github.com/Sunlitspace542/star-fox-msu1-pcm),
which is based on Aelieth's Church of Kondo set with additions and remapping
for Sunlit's patch. The pack README also thanks qwertymodo for MSUPCM++.
