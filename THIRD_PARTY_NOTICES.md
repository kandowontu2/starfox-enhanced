and the upstream headers. This component is independent of NVIDIA DLSS.

## Optional Windows x64 NVIDIA DLSS runtime

### SDL3 UWP/WinRT fork

Source: <https://github.com/SternXD/SDL3-uwp>

Pinned revision: `8fd8db768df139e9bb4c7a7869fb913a0e29ea89`

The Xbox Developer Mode target uses this maintained SDL 3.4.10-compatible
fork because official SDL no longer ships its UWP backend. The fork retains
SDL's zlib licence above and supplies the WinRT D3D11, WASAPI, filesystem, and
gamepad integration used by the UWP package.

### SDL3 Nintendo Switch libnx backend

Source: <https://github.com/neomody77/sdl3-switch>

Pinned revision: `182e511214d7600e4bdab8606d7caf0ef744afd6`

The Nintendo Switch homebrew target applies the pinned backend patch to SDL
3.4.14. The patch is distributed under SDL's zlib licence, is plainly marked
as a modified SDL source, and its upstream repository states that the backend
was generated with AI assistance and verified on real libnx hardware. It is
used only because upstream SDL's official Nintendo backend is NDA-gated and is
not available to public devkitPro builds.

## Star Fox MSU-1 PCM set

Source: <https://github.com/Sunlitspace542/star-fox-msu1-pcm>

Pinned revision: `7a86296d7f62fd26bc2c51a7ed43eda8e4b21588`

The compressed source tracks are packaged separately as the optional
`Starfox-MSU1.PAK` companion when `STARFOX_PACKAGE_MSU1_MUSIC` is enabled.
The set was assembled by
SunlitSpace542 from Aelieth's Church of Kondo set, with changes and additions
for Sunlit's MSU-1 track mapping. The pack README thanks qwertymodo for
MSUPCM++. Original Star Fox compositions remain credited to Hajime Hirasawa.
No standalone licence file is included by the pinned music-pack repository;
this notice records provenance and attribution and does not alter any rights
in the music or the underlying game.

Source: <https://github.com/janisozaur/xbrz>

Pinned revision: `93c54433fa0df37c689c919e8152fb0b9136584a`

Copyright (C) Zenju (zenju AT gmx DOT de)

Licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 3. Used as the optional
`XBRZ` backend of the `2D FILTER` presentation option. It is fetched and
compiled by default; `-DSTARFOX_ENABLE_XBRZ=OFF` omits it in minimal builds.
The GPU adaptation in `src/render/shaders/xbrz_compute.hlsli` and
`src/render/shaders/xbrz_weights.hlsli`, including their generated SPIR-V/Metal
representations in `src/render/shaders/generated`, is also derived from this implementation
and covered by GPLv3. Distributing a binary containing either implementation carries the GPLv3
obligations for the combined work.
