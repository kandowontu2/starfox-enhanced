> This is an alpha release, not a cycle-accurate SNES emulator. A supported,
> unmodified retail ROM supplied by you is required. No retail ROM is included.

## Get started

1. Download the package for your platform. Desktop users should extract it
   into a writable folder before launching; no source build is necessary.
2. Launch the game. On desktop, place your supported `.sfc`/`.smc` ROM beside
   the executable, or set `STARFOX_RETAIL_ROM` to its path. Mobile apps provide
   a first-launch file picker.
3. The game validates your ROM and creates `Starfox-Assets.BIN` locally.
   On macOS it is saved in your writable application data folder, not inside
   the `.app` bundle (which may be read-only under Gatekeeper). On other
   desktop platforms, keep the companion with the application. It may need
   rebuilding after updates to the embedded assets.
4. Choose **Original** or **Star Fox EX**, adjust your options, then select
   **Start Game** from the main menu.

For devices needing prepared assets, the release includes a standalone Windows
[asset builder](https://github.com/kandowontu2/starfox-enhanced/blob/main/platform/mobile/ASSET_BUILDER.md). It accepts the same ROMs;
mobile users can also select a ROM directly.

### Supported ROMs

- Star Fox Japan: 1.0 / 1.1
- Star Fox USA: 1.0 / 1.1 / 1.2
- Starwing Europe: 1.0 / 1.1
- Starwing Germany: 1.0

A 512-byte copier header is accepted. Known revisions are checksum-verified
and canonicalized before the source-built patches are applied. Hacks, betas,
competition cartridges, Star Fox 2 and unknown revisions are not supported.

## Platforms

| Package | Notes |
|---|---|
| Windows x64 / x86 | Extract and run `starfox_pc.exe`. |
| Linux x64 | Native SDL3 runtime. |
| macOS universal | Unsigned application for Intel and Apple Silicon. |
| iOS arm64 | Unsigned device bundle; [signing/sideloading instructions](https://github.com/kandowontu2/starfox-enhanced/blob/main/platform/apple/IOS_INSTALL.md). |
| Android arm64 | Signed APK; release updates retain the original signing certificate. |
| Nintendo Switch | Homebrew NRO; [setup and optional forwarder](https://github.com/kandowontu2/starfox-enhanced/blob/main/platform/switch/README.md). |
| PS Vita | Homebrew VPK; [setup](https://github.com/kandowontu2/starfox-enhanced/blob/main/platform/vita/README.md). |
| PS5 | Homebrew native title (fake-signed folder); [setup](https://github.com/kandowontu2/starfox-enhanced/blob/main/platform/ps5/README.md). |
| Xbox UWP x64 | Developer Mode required; [setup](https://github.com/kandowontu2/starfox-enhanced/blob/main/platform/uwp/README.md). |
| Windows PCVR / Quest 3 | Experimental OpenXR packages; [VR setup](https://github.com/kandowontu2/starfox-enhanced/blob/main/docs/VR-BUILD.md). |
| Steam Frame (native, ARM64) | Experimental native OpenXR build that runs on the headset itself; [setup and notes](https://github.com/kandowontu2/starfox-enhanced/blob/main/docs/STEAM-FRAME.md). |

Build success does not guarantee identical behavior on every device.
See the [release notes](https://github.com/kandowontu2/starfox-enhanced/blob/main/docs/RELEASE-0.0.8.md) for verification limits.

An [experimental Nintendo 3DS port](platform/3ds/README.md) has a native
tester package with the real pre-game menu and lower-screen cockpit HUD.
New 3DS/XL are the slider-stereo target; original 3DS/XL and 2DS use mono.
[Installation and testing instructions](platform/3ds/TESTING.md) identify
the current candidate. Native builds pass CI, but physical-console
performance and complete gameplay acceptance remain unverified.

**Android/Quest upgrades:** release builds retain the recovered original signing
certificate. No signing-key change or reinstall is required for 0.0.8.

## Features and settings

- **Original and EX:** original routes and frontend flow, plus EX's shipped
  campaigns, native options and mechanics.
- **Smooth presentation:** 20–480 FPS choices, defaulting to 60. Game pace is
  independent of render FPS; Original Speed preserves source-style slowdown.
- **Display:** 4:3, 16:10, 16:9, 21:9 and 32:9; GPU or software presentation.
- **Languages:** English, English (Europe), Japanese, German, French and Spanish, including menus
  and dialogue. EX translations include authored additions.
- **2D Options:** artwork filtering, 2D Bloom, World Effects and their intensity.
  The artwork filter also covers textures on 3D polygons.
- **3D Options:** anti-aliasing, VSync, 1–4× Render Upscale, 3D Bloom, 3D Smoothing,
  Enhanced Lighting, HDR Effect, Ray Tracing (hardware DXR shadows, default Off),
  Chromatic Aberration, Model Effects
  and Model Effect Intensity. HDR Effect is brightness/contrast
  processing, **not HDR display output**.
  Ray Tracing replaces original shadows rather than drawing a second set;
  there is no separate Enhanced Shadows toggle.
- **Preview:** a fixed reference scene shows graphics changes live. Hold **Tab**
  to hide the menu temporarily. Preview defaults off each launch.
- **Customization:** draggable HUD layouts, controller/keyboard remapping,
  crosshair colors, separate music/SFX volumes, rumble and optional God Mode.

Model and world effects are independent; CEL-DRAWN is model-only and BLUEPRINT
is world-only. Most visual enhancements are optional. Higher render scales and
additional effects can increase CPU, GPU and memory use.

Optional Original MSU-1 music requires `Starfox-MSU1.PAK` beside the desktop
executable (or in the platform's writable storage). It is not included in the
standard packages. Without it, native SPC music remains available.

See [Settings and controls](https://github.com/kandowontu2/starfox-enhanced/blob/main/docs/SETTINGS-AND-CONTROLS.md) for detailed options,
EX peripherals, multiplayer and presentation debugging.

## Default controls

| SNES control | Keyboard | Gamepad position |
|---|---|---|
| D-pad | Arrow keys | D-pad / left stick |
| B | Z | South |
| Y | A | West |
| A | X | East |
| X | S | North |
| L / R | Q / W | Shoulder buttons |
| Select | Apostrophe (`'`) | Back/View |
| Start | Enter | Start/Menu |

Button names above follow the SNES layout, not the letters printed on an Xbox
controller. Remap controls under **Options → Controller**. Menu A actions fire
once per press; B or Back returns from submenus.

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| Escape | Exit confirmation |
| Tab in setup | Hide the menu while held |
| Tab / Ctrl+Tab / Ctrl+Shift+Tab outside setup | 2× / 3× / 5× fast-forward |
| Ctrl+Shift+R | Reset; remap the final key under Keyboard → Reset |
| Ctrl+Alt+F12 | Toggle God Mode live |
| Ctrl+F1 / Ctrl+F2 | Save / load the selected state slot |
| Ctrl+F3 | Select state slot 0–9; arrows or D-pad, Enter/A to close |
| F12 on the main setup page | Enable/disable presentation history for this run |
| F5 / F6 / F7 | Freeze / step forward / step backward with history enabled |

## Saves and upgrades

Windows/Linux desktop builds are portable: keep these files beside the
executable when moving or upgrading. macOS stores them in its writable user
application-data folder so an unsigned, Gatekeeper-translocated `.app` can
import a ROM without writing into its read-only bundle. Older macOS bundle
settings/saves are copied there on first launch when available.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Starfox-Assets.BIN` | Locally reconstructed runtime assets |
| `starfox-ex.srm` | EX cartridge SRAM |
| `pregame.cfg` | Game and graphics preferences |
| `input-bindings.cfg` | Keyboard and controller mappings |
| `hud-layout.cfg` | Per-experience, per-aspect-ratio HUD layouts |
| `Starfox-MSU1.PAK` | Optional replacement music |

The first normal launch copies missing data from former preference locations;
existing portable files win, and originals are not deleted. Mobile and console
builds use writable platform storage instead of their read-only package folders.

## Development and credits

To build, regenerate source assets or run tests, use the
[build guide](https://github.com/kandowontu2/starfox-enhanced/blob/main/docs/BUILDING.md). The
[architecture notes](https://github.com/kandowontu2/starfox-enhanced/blob/main/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) explain the hybrid native/65C816
boundary: gameplay remains fixed-point while extra presentation frames are
interpolated. Visual parity remains an ongoing effort.

## FAQ

Q) The speed on "ORIGINAL" is not lining up exactly with an snes reply.

A) Thats because the speed on the SNES is variable depending on how many models on are screen. The "ORIGINAL" pace is an average speed without overload, as close to original as possible. An "ACCURATE" option may come in the future.


Q) THERES XXXXX BUG (AND IVE BEEN REPORTING IT FOR WEEKS)

A) There's a lot to do. A lot. With your patience, it WILL be perfect in time. See the version number? It's accurate.


Q) Will you add Starfox 2/SF Contest/Starglider?

A) Starfox 2: yes. SF Contest: maybe. Starglider: maybe.


Q) Is AI used in this??

A) Yep. I, however, am not personally installing it on your pc or forcing you to play it.


Q) How do I reset settings to default?

A) Hold L+R on the pre-game menu until it resets the settings.

Q) What have you personally tested this on?
A) Retroid Pocket Flip (60fps with no upscaling effects, less with any), iPhone 17 Pro Max (120fps with 2x upscaling and raytracing), Steam Deck, Quest 3, PC.
